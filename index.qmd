## neuromodulatory control of circuit function
:::{#hero-heading}
Hi, welcome to my page! I am postdoc in the field of Systems Neuroscience and I am interested in state-dependent information processing in neural circuits.
These days, I work in the group of [Rainer Friedrich](https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119) at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research](https://www.fmi.ch/) in Basel, Switzerland. Before that, I did my PhD with [Erin Schuman](https://brain.mpg.de/schuman) at the [Max Planck Institute for Brain Research](https://brain.mpg.de/home) in Frankfurt, Germany.
