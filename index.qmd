## neuromodulatory control of circuit function
:::{#hero-heading}
Hi, welcome to my page! I am postdoc in the field of Systems Neuroscience and I am interested in state-dependent information processing in neural circuits.
These days, I work in the group of [Rainer Friedrich](https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119) at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research](https://www.fmi.ch/) in Basel, Switzerland. Before that, I did my PhD with [Erin Schuman](https://brain.mpg.de/schuman) at the [Max Planck Institute for Brain Research](https://brain.mpg.de/home) in Frankfurt, Germany. On this site, I give an overview of previous projects and current ideas. Feel free to look around!

My journey in science started in 2010, when I enrolled at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in the north of Bavaria. I majored in Molecular Medicine, and joined the lab of [Beate Winner](https://www.stammzellbiologie.uk-erlangen.de/en/) for my thesis work. Shinya Yamanaka had just won the Nobel prize for his [groundbreaking work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024) on the induction of pluripotent stem cells. In a nutshell, these insights enabled researchers to retrieve cells from human patients, re-program them to the pluripotent stage and differentiate them into cell types of interest, such as neural cells. That made it possible to work on actual human neuron-like cells in a lab to better understand diseases which were hard to model in other systems at the time. The Winner lab did exactly that, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS or HSP. During my time there, for the first time, I was exposed to molecular biology techniques and actual lab work - a fascinating world that I would continue to explore for the years to come. My work there resulted in a co-authorship on a [paper on SPG11](https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24633), one of the genes responsible for the onset of HSP.  

I decided to fully focus on neuroscience and moved to Heidelberg for my graduate studies.
