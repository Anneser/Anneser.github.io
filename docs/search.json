I am postdoc in the field of Systems Neuroscience and I am interested in state-dependent information processing in neural circuits. These days, I work in the group of Rainer Friedrich at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. Before that, I did my PhD with Erin Schuman at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt, Germany. On this site, I give an overview of previous projects and current ideas. Feel free to look around!\nMy journey in science started in 2010, when I enrolled at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in the north of Bavaria. I majored in Molecular Medicine, and joined the lab of Beate Winner for my thesis work. Shinya Yamanaka had just won the Nobel prize for his groundbreaking work on the induction of pluripotent stem cells. In a nutshell, these insights enabled researchers to retrieve cells from human patients, re-program them to the pluripotent stage and differentiate them into cell types of interest, such as neural cells. That made it possible to work on actual human neuron-like cells in a lab to better understand diseases which were hard to model in other systems at the time. The Winner lab did exactly that, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS or HSP. During my time there, for the first time, I was exposed to molecular biology techniques and actual lab work - a fascinating world that I would continue to explore for the years to come. My work there resulted in a co-authorship on a paper on SPG11, one of the genes responsible for the onset of HSP.\nI decided to fully focus on neuroscience and moved to Heidelberg for my graduate studies. Here, I wanted to get some broad exposure to different aspects of the brain and applied for internships in a variety of labs. I initially did some rotations in groups performing electrophysiological recordings in rodents ex vivo and in vivo and later went for half a year to New Haven to work in the Colón-Ramos lab on synaptogenesis in C. elegans. I did my thesis work with Detlev Arendt at the EMBL on the topic of cell type evolution in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii. After getting some impression of what kind of questions I felt most drawn to, I applied for the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) centered around the MPI for Brain Research in Frankfurt.\nDuring my time in the group of Erin Schuman, I tried to understand how social isolation impacts the brain transcriptome. This work resulted in some interesting insights into the role of the neuropeptide Pth2 in responding to different social environments and regulating appropriate behavioral responses. I also collaborated with a fellow PhD student on the behavioral analysis of oxytocin-receptor deficient fish. By and large, I developed quite some expertise on the level of molecular biology techniques and behavioral analysis.\nFor my postdoc, I joined the lab of Rainer Friedrich at the FMI in Basel, Switzerland. This lab excels at the systematic analysis of neural circuit connectivity and physiological recordings of neuronal populations using 2-photon imaging. I was keen on expanding my technical repertoire to systems level approaches such as these, but I first wanted to leverage my already established expertise and conducted a single-cell sequencing screen of the zebrafish telencephalon to identify cell populations warranting a closer look. This analysis suggested that the activity of neurons (i.e., the way they process information) is subject to modulation by a plethora of so-called neuromodulators, small molecules secreted by other cells in the brain that have lasting consequences on the physiological parameters determining neuronal activity. For the time being, I am very keen to understand how this combinatorial complexity of neuromodulatory actions could be understood."
