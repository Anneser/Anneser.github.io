I am postdoc in the field of Systems Neuroscience and I am interested in state-dependent information processing in neural circuits. These days, I work in the group of Rainer Friedrich at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. Before that, I did my PhD with Erin Schuman at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt, Germany. On this site, I give an overview of previous projects and current ideas. Feel free to look around!\nMy journey in science started in 2010, when I enrolled at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in the north of Bavaria. I majored in Molecular Medicine, and joined the lab of Beate Winner for my thesis work. Shinya Yamanaka had just won the Nobel prize for his groundbreaking work on the induction of pluripotent stem cells. In a nutshell, these insights enabled researchers to retrieve cells from human patients, re-program them to the pluripotent stage and differentiate them into cell types of interest, such as neural cells. That made it possible to work on actual human neuron-like cells in a lab to better understand diseases which were hard to model in other systems at the time. The Winner lab did exactly that, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS or HSP. During my time there, for the first time, I was exposed to molecular biology techniques and actual lab work - a fascinating world that I would continue to explore for the years to come. My work there resulted in a co-authorship on a paper on SPG11, one of the genes responsible for the onset of HSP.\nI decided to fully focus on neuroscience and moved to Heidelberg for my graduate studies. Here, I wanted to get some broad exposure to different aspects of the brain and applied for internships in a variety of labs. I initially did some rotations in groups performing electrophysiological recordings in rodents ex vivo and in vivo and later went for half a year to New Haven to work in the Colón-Ramos lab on synaptogenesis in C. elegans. I did my thesis work with Detlev Arendt at the EMBL on the topic of cell type evolution in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii. After getting some impression of what kind of questions I felt most drawn to, I applied for the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) centered around the MPI for Brain Research in Frankfurt.\nDuring my time in the group of Erin Schuman, I tried to understand how social isolation impacts the brain transcriptome. This work resulted in some interesting insights into the role of the neuropeptide Pth2 in responding to different social environments and regulating appropriate behavioral responses. I also collaborated with a fellow PhD student on the behavioral analysis of oxytocin-receptor deficient fish. By and large, I developed quite some expertise on the level of molecular biology techniques and behavioral analysis.\nFor my postdoc, I joined the lab of Rainer Friedrich at the FMI in Basel, Switzerland. This lab excels at the systematic analysis of neural circuit connectivity and physiological recordings of neuronal populations using 2-photon imaging. I was keen on expanding my technical repertoire to systems level approaches such as these, but I first wanted to leverage my already established expertise and conducted a single-cell sequencing screen of the zebrafish telencephalon to identify cell populations warranting a closer look. This analysis suggested that the activity of neurons (i.e., the way they process information) is subject to modulation by a plethora of so-called neuromodulators, small molecules secreted by other cells in the brain that have lasting consequences on the physiological parameters determining neuronal activity. For the time being, I am very keen to understand how this combinatorial complexity of neuromodulatory actions could be understood."

    "section": "Hippocampal representation of a linear track",
    "text": "Hippocampal representation of a linear track\nThe ability of the hippocampal formation to represent the place of an animal within its spatial context has been explored for over 50 years. Most notably, when animals move through an environment, some hippocampal cells will only become active whenever a certain place is visited. These kind of cells became known as place cells and form one of the bedrocks of the neuroscientific field of spatial navigation.\nThe cell type identity of these neurons is almost never explicitly addressed. In early electrophysiological recordings, it was simply not possible to discern what kind of neuron one recorded from, and even when it became feasible, questions along these lines never took center-stage. However, the hippocampus is not a monolithic tissue with only one kind of neuron, but an intricate anatomical structure made up of a diverse set of cell types. This is indeed a general feature of neural circuits that, with the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing, has become more and more appreciated and to refer to the excitable cells inside the brain simply as neurons doesn`t do justice to the multiplicity of shapes and functions observed and described. In the paper, Esparza et al. ask about the contribution of differently located pyramidal cells (PCs) to the representation of a linear track. To be precise, they are able to perform targeted recordings either from superficial or deep PCs (they do this be using either transgenic animals or deliver calcium reporters to gene populations of interest via virus injections).\nThis approach facilitates a peculiar take on the population level analysis. Normally, one would temporally bin neuronal activity and depict the firing rate (or the corresponding proxy) of each neuron on one axis of an n-dimensional space, with n being the number of recorded neurons. In this space, one can now analyse the features of the subspace being carved out by the population analysis. In this case, however, the authors can additionally ask what kind of properties are contributed by which cell types. For a first characterization, they simply captured hippocampal activity from an animal running back and forth on a linear track. Consistent with what one would expect from previous research, the resulting subspace occupied by neuronal activity (the manifold) is best described as a tridimensional ring for both kind of neuronal subpopulations. However, the representations differed in subtle ways the authors took great care to characterize. As a side note, the methodological considerations put forward were one of the highlights of this publication for me. Every step of the analysis was motivated with great care and described simply and intuitively. I would recommend to check out the github repo to get an impression of what accompanying code should look like. For example, the authors use a method called angle-based intrinsic dimensionality (ABID) as described by Thordsen et al., 2020 to determine the above mentioned tridimensionality of the observed manifold. This method computes the directional vectors for points neighboring a reference point in an n-dimensional space, and computes the average pairwise cosine similarity for these vectors. The intrinsic dimensionality is then given by the inverse of this value. If the data lives in a high-dimensional space, the vectors will point in random directions and the cosine similarity is low, thus resulting in a high ABID value. Pure algorithmic beauty! Anyway, back to the paper."

    "section": "As the environment changes, so does the representation",
    "text": "As the environment changes, so does the representation\nThe most striking observation about the ring-like manifolds was the difference in their responses to the manipulation of spatial cues. As a simple experimental intervention, the track was simply rotated inside the lab, resulting in a 180 ° mismatch between local and global cues for the rodents navigating the track before and after this rotation. For both superficial and deep neurons, the manipulation resulted in a displacement of the ring. However, the ring-like representation of the deep neurons was additionally rotated by 180 °, matching the change in the outside world. Fascinatingly, for someone simply recording from the entirety of CA1, this manifold rotation would not be visible as this pooling over different cell populations appears to mask some subpopulation-specific features. To me, this is an insanely important insight. These days, neuroscientists push for ever-increasing FOVs, better genetically encoded activity indicators, and deliberately record from tiny animals as these creatures enable measurements from the entire nervous system at once. Indeed, there is value in completeness because somewhere in the resulting dataset, there is the information we are after. However, Esparza and colleagues remind us here of another important concept of science: to carve reality at its joints. To simply record large datasets without knowing how to subdivide, cluster, and analyze them might actually be detrimental. The scientist recording the entire CA1 population might wrongly conclude that the rotational mismatch simply induces a displacement of the manifold, while there are actually subpopulations tracking the precise rotation between local and global cues. The identity of the cells we record from is necessary to stratify the ever-growing datasets and only by doing so will we not be blind to computations otherwise lost in the noise of completeness."
